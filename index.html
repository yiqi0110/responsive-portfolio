                I do not really talk about myself often so this will be interesting, just a fair warning to those reading
                this page. I'm a student at DU's coding boot camp for web development. I also work as a server at Izakaya Den,
                so I'm essentially working full-time. Outside of work and school I don't really do all that much other than cook
                and drink, However I am a fairly avid gamer. RPG, puzzle, strategy, shooters, MOBA, MMORPG, etc. just list a
                few of the categories of games I enjoy.

                Obviously this has very little to do with coding and probably not what your looking for in a web page about 
                someone, but this can help me say that I'm a bit boring without actually saying so. I am however, a determined
                individual and I don't mind working past the time-clock. I also enjoy a good amount of challenge, obviously 
                not enough to make me rage in frustration as I'm sure most people would say. I also work and think at my own
                pace, which is why many of my friends and family can only understand half of what I'm saying at a given time.
